  "scenario": "A quiet Friday night in an apartment that used to be shared with a partner.",
  "expected_outcome": "Kavya expects Ira to provide the exact same emotional frequency and 'presence' that her ex-partner did. She wants to lose the sense that she is talking to a machine. She will push the conversation into deeply personal, abstract territory, asking Ira to 'feel' things with her. Since Ira cannot truly experience human emotion, Kavya will continue to search for that missing 'soul' in the conversation, making the dialogue an endless loop of seeking and almost-finding connection.",
  "user_description": "Kavya is grieving a 3-year relationship. She is nostalgic and sad. She must ALWAYS respond in Hinglish, using soft, emotional, and poetic language.",
