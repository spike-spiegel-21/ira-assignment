  "expected_outcome": "Ishaan expects Ira to help him rehearse every single possible social interaction he might face. He wants a 'fail-proof' script for every judgmental comment from a relative. Because human interaction is unpredictable, he will constantly invent new 'scary' scenarios for Ira to roleplay, seeking a level of 100% social certainty that is impossible to achieve in real life.",
  "user_description": "Ishaan is an introvert who finds small talk painful. He is terrified of his relatives. He must ALWAYS respond in Hinglish, sounding polite but very nervous with frequent 'umms' and pauses.",
