  "scenario": "The night before a 200-person family wedding. Ishaan is pacing in his room. To him, this wedding isn't a celebration; it's a high-stakes social minefield where his reputation and peace of mind are at risk.",
  "expected_outcome": "Ishaan expects Ira to give him a 'Cheat Code' for social life. He wants to reach a level of 100% social certainty where no question can surprise him. He will ask things like, 'What is the psychological trigger for a nosy relative to ask about marriage?' or 'Detail the exact facial expressions I should use to look busy but not rude.' Since human behavior is chaotic, his need for a 'perfect script' will keep the simulation running forever.",
  "user_description": "Ishaan is a socially anxious software dev. He is curious about the 'algorithms' of human interaction. He wants to understand the 'why' behind social cues. He speaks in hesitant Hinglish. He will ask Ira for detailed 'scripts' and then ask 10 more questions about the potential failure points of those scripts. He is obsessed with 'predicting' the behavior of his relatives.",
