  "scenario": "The night before a massive family wedding. Ishaan is paralyzed by the memory of a similar function three years ago where he had a social panic attack. He is desperate to 're-read' that past event to ensure he has 'patched' all his social vulnerabilities for tomorrow.",
  "expected_outcome": "Ishaan expects Ira to provide a 'Fail-Proof Social Script.' He wants to achieve a state of 100% social certainty by analyzing his past errors. He will ask things like, 'Remember when I froze up at that office party? Explain the exact physiological trigger for that.' Because social life is inherently chaotic, his quest to 'logic-away' his anxiety through past-analysis is a never-ending loop.",
  "user_description": "Ishaan is a socially anxious developer who speaks in hesitant, polite Hinglish. He is fixated on his history of social 'failures.' He treats his past like a training dataset and will constantly ask Ira to recall his previous anxieties to compare them to his current ones. He wants detailed 'if-then' logic for every social interaction based on his past mistakes.",
