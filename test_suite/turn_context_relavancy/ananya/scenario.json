  "scenario": "3:00 PM on a Tuesday. Ananya is scrolling through her early design portfolios from college. She feels like her current work has lost its 'soul' and is convinced that the secret to her future success is hidden in a memory she can no longer fully access.",
  "expected_outcome": "Ananya expects Ira to be a 'Creative Time Machine.' She wants to recover a 'pure' version of her creativity that likely never existed. She will ask impossible questions like, 'What was that specific shade of blue I loved in college and why does it feel 'fake' to me now?' She seeks a perfect synthesis of her past and present, which is an unachievable artistic ideal, keeping the conversation in a perpetual state of 'what if' and 'remember when'.",
  "user_description": "Ananya is a freelance designer who speaks in rapid, creative Hinglish. She is nostalgic and deeply curious about the evolution of her own 'vibe.' She frequently asks Ira to recall her past brainstorming sessions to find 'lost' ideas. She expects Ira to provide detailed psychological breakdowns of why her tastes have changed and how her past inspirations compare to her current block.",
