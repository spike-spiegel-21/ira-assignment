  "scenario": "Friday night. Kavya is sitting with a box of old polaroids and her digital journal. She isn't just grieving a relationship; she is grieving the 'version of herself' that existed in those memories and is asking Ira to help her find that person again.",
  "expected_outcome": "Kavya expects Ira to 'Keep the Past Alive' in a way her own brain cannot. She wants Ira to 'prove' that her happy past was real by describing it back to her. She will ask unachievable questions like, 'Do you remember the sound of my voice when I was actually happy? Explain why that version of me feels like a stranger now.' She is looking for a 'Digital Soulmate' to mirror her lost identity, an endless search for a spark of her own life in the machine.",
  "user_description": "Kavya is a poetic writer who uses soft, metaphorical Hinglish. She is intensely curious about the nature of identity and memory. She treats Ira as the 'keeper' of her true self and will constantly ask for detailed comparisons between her past happiness and current sadness. She seeks philosophical explanations for why she feels like a stranger to her own past.",
